    <h3 id="day-11-monkey-in-the-middle">— Day 11: Monkey in the Middle
    —</h3>
    <p>As you finally start making your way upriver, you realize your
    pack is much lighter than you remember. Just then, one of the items
    from your pack goes flying overhead. Monkeys are playing Keep Away
    with your missing things!</p>
    <p>To get your stuff back, you need to be able to predict where the
    monkeys will throw your items. After some careful observation, you
    realize the monkeys operate based on <strong>how worried you are
    about each item</strong>.</p>
    <p>You take some notes (your puzzle input) on the items each monkey
    currently has, how worried you are about those items, and how the
    monkey makes decisions based on your worry level. For example:</p>
    <pre><code>Monkey 0:
  Starting items: 79, 98
  Operation: new = old * 19
  Test: divisible by 23
    If true: throw to monkey 2
    If false: throw to monkey 3

Monkey 1:
  Starting items: 54, 65, 75, 74
  Operation: new = old + 6
  Test: divisible by 19
    If true: throw to monkey 2
    If false: throw to monkey 0

Monkey 2:
  Starting items: 79, 60, 97
  Operation: new = old * old
  Test: divisible by 13
    If true: throw to monkey 1
    If false: throw to monkey 3

Monkey 3:
  Starting items: 74
  Operation: new = old + 3
  Test: divisible by 17
    If true: throw to monkey 0
    If false: throw to monkey 1</code></pre>
    <p>Each monkey has several attributes:</p>
    <ul>
    <li><code>Starting items</code> lists your <strong>worry
    level</strong> for each item the monkey is currently holding in the
    order they will be inspected.</li>
    <li><code>Operation</code> shows how your worry level changes as
    that monkey inspects an item. (An operation like
    <code>new = old * 5</code> means that your worry level after the
    monkey inspected the item is five times whatever your worry level
    was before inspection.)</li>
    <li><code>Test</code> shows how the monkey uses your worry level to
    decide where to throw an item next.
    <ul>
    <li><code>If true</code> shows what happens with an item if the
    <code>Test</code> was true.</li>
    <li><code>If false</code> shows what happens with an item if the
    <code>Test</code> was false.</li>
    </ul></li>
    </ul>
    <p>After each monkey inspects an item but before it tests your worry
    level, your relief that the monkey’s inspection didn’t damage the
    item causes your worry level to be <strong>divided by three</strong>
    and rounded down to the nearest integer.</p>
    <p>The monkeys take turns inspecting and throwing items. On a single
    monkey’s <strong>turn</strong>, it inspects and throws all the items
    it is holding one at a time and in the order listed. Monkey
    <code>0</code> goes first, then monkey <code>1</code>, and so on
    until each monkey has had one turn. The process of each monkey
    taking a single turn is called a <strong>round</strong>.</p>
    <p>When a monkey throws an item to another monkey, the item goes on
    the <strong>end</strong> of the recipient monkey’s list. A monkey
    that starts a round with no items could end up inspecting and
    throwing many items by the time its turn comes around. If a monkey
    is holding no items at the start of its turn, its turn ends.</p>
    <p>In the above example, the first round proceeds as follows:</p>
    <pre><code>Monkey 0:

    <p>Chasing all the monkeys at once is impossible; you’re going to
    have to focus on the<strong>two most active</strong> monkeys if you
    want any hope of getting your stuff back. Count the <strong>total
    number of times each monkey inspects items</strong> over 20
    rounds:</p>
    <pre><code>Monkey 0 inspected items 101 times. &lt;&lt; this
Monkey 1 inspected items 95 times.
Monkey 2 inspected items 7 times.
Monkey 3 inspected items 105 times. &lt;&lt; and this</code></pre>
    <p>In this example, the two most active monkeys inspected items 101
    and 105 times. The level of <strong>monkey business</strong> in this
    situation can be found by multiplying these together:
    <strong>10605</strong>.</p>
    <p>Figure out which monkeys to chase by counting how many items they
    inspect over 20 rounds. <strong>What is the level of monkey business
    after 20 rounds of stuff-slinging simian shenanigans?</strong></p>
